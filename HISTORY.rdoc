=== 0.6.4 2013-01-02

* Minor changes to support ruby 1.9

= RELEASE HISTORY

== 0.6.3 / 2010-09-21

This release allows the english library to be loaded via <code>require 'en'</code>.
This offeres a way to get around Ruby's own English.rb library on case insensitive
systems.

Changes:

* Add `en.rb` redirection script.
* Ruby Facets is no longer needed as a dependency.


== 0.6.2 / 2010-06-19

Restored last #singularize and #pluralize aliases for #singular and #plural.

Changes:

* Restored common aliases #singularize and #pluralize.


== 0.6.1 / 2010-06-05

This release entails two enhancments. A simple bug fix for
the #conjunction method, and the completion of integrating
Michael Granger's Infinitive module into the library.

Changes:

* Integrated Infinitive module.
* Fixed #conjunction method.


== 0.6.0 / 2010-05-29

This release is a significant milestone and short of any bug reports
will become the 1.0 release in the coming months. The biggest change
is the dependency on Language library, which is a spin-off of English
to house language neutral and multi-language code.

Changes:

* Major Enhancments

  * Language library spun-off.
  * Reduced three class design to a single class.


== 0.5.0 / 2009-10-03

Initial progress towards a more elegant design. This release
it turns out is a little premature. I do not recommed using
it in production. But it does provide a feel for were
English is headed.

Changes:

* 3 Major Enhancements

  * New three class design (English::String, English::Array, English::Integer).
  * Use #method_missing to dispatch language methods to correct language module.
  * Split obfustcate.rb back out to dresner.rb and jumble.rb.

* 1 Deprecation

  * Deprecated roman.rb (put back in Ruby Facets).


== 0.4.0 / 2009-06-06

This version of English (v0.4.0) is the first step in a two part
process to scale the library back to it's "pure English" roots.
With limited exceptions, library scripts that are not strictly related
to providing routines for working with the English language will be
deprecated. Any useful deprecated functionality will most likely be
supported in Ruby Facets instead.

Changes:

* 3 Major Enhancements

  * dresner.rb and jumble.rb are deprecated (use obfuscate.rb instead).
  * string.rb has been renamed words.rb
  * created namecase.rb (used to be in case.rb)


== 0.3.0 / 2008-09-27

English's Inflect performance has been greatly improved.
Inflect had used sorting and a comparision loop to find matches
for singular and plural conversions. Now it uses a single Regexp
which handles all the matching grunt work on it's own and
provides a 10x performance gain! Thanks goes to Wycats
for this superb work on this.

English has also gained a new Style module which extends the
String class. This mixin provides an assortment of String
alteration methods such as titlecase, jumble, pathize, etc;
all the ones you would expect and then some.

Changes:

* 3 Major Enhancements

    * Applied wycats improvements to inflect.rb. Now 10x faster!
    * Renamed database.rb to orm.rb and metacode.rb to code.rb.
    * Added style.rb from Facets.

* 5 Minor Enhancements

    * Added warning to old jumble.rb and dresner.rb.
    * Added rule 'ess', 'esses' to inflect.rb.
    * Fixed vertex plural.
    * Fixed similarity require.
    * Minor adjustments to English::Filter.


== 0.2.0 / 2008-02-07

Continued work in general orginaization, deciding what will and will not
be included, what the best names for things are, etc.

Changes:

* 7 Major Enhancements

    * Added roman.rb
    * Added jumble.rb.
    * Added porter_stemmingrb
    * Added levenshtien.rb.
    * Merged wordfilter.rb into censor.rb.
    * Renamed metaphone.rb to double_metaphone.rb.
    * Merged rewrite.rb into censor.rb.

* 3 Minor Enhancements

    * Improved soundex.rb.
    * Added grammer reference to docs.
    * Added double_metaphone test.


== 0.1.0 / 2007-08-01

English is a spin-off project from Ruby Facets, collecting
a number of english-related libraries under a single unified
package. This is the first stab at pulling these libraries
together.

Changes:

* Happy Birthday!
