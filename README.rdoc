== DESCRIPTION

English is a spin-off of Facets, collecting together all English
language libraries together under a single unified project. The English
project intends to provided a general purpose set of English-oriented 
text manipulation and natural language processing Ruby libraries in one
convenient package.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see the HISTORY file.


== SYNOPSIS

The primary means of usage is via the English::String class.
A normal Ruby +String+ can be quickly concerted to an +English::String+
class using the +#en+ method. With the converted object you can
call any of the string-based English methods.

  require 'english/inflect'

  "Goose".en.plural  #=> "Geese"

By loading the 'language/mixin' library, you can further remove
the need for the #en method. Instead the Language module will
use whatever language is set as *current*. By default 'en' is
the current language setting.

  require 'language/mixin'

  "Goose".plural  #=> "Geese"

To load the entire English library, including the 'lanaguage/mixin'
script, simply use:

  require 'english'

See Language project for more information on support for other languages.
For details on all the methods the English library supplies see the
<a href="rubyworks.github.com/english/rdoc/">API documentation</a>.

NOTE: If your system has a case insensitive file system, an alternative
to +english.rb+ is provided. Use +en.rb+ instead:

  require 'en'


== INSTALLATION

Using RubyGems

  $ sudo gem install english

We do not recommend site installations any longer, but if you need
to do so, you can download the .tar.gz file from GitHub and use
<a href="proutils.github.com/setup/">Ruby Setup<a/> to install
English manually:

  $ tar -xvzf english-1.0.0.tar.gz
  $ cd english-1.0.0
  $ sudo setup.rb

For Windows users the last line needs to be 'ruby setup.rb'.


== TESTING

To run the test suite without installing, you can use:

  $ script/test
